# MachineLearning-DT-SVM-NN-
OBJECTIVE:
You have been provided with a dataset with attributes about the ICO projects from different
fundraising teams / companies. For this coursework, you need to predict whether a
team/company will reach its fundraising goal successfully through the ICO, using
various machine learning models.

The assignment submission should be a technical report with a summary of the analyses
performed. Your report must have the following sections:
• Introduction (Business understanding)
o This is to set the context of this technical report by describing the business
context and the background of the task.

• Data Understanding
o Show evidence of your understanding of the data, e.g. distributions,
visualisations of the data, etc.

• Data Preparation
o Describe how you pre-process the raw data to get it ready for modelling in
the next stage. E.g., how you handle missing values, incorrect values, and
outliers; how you transform the data format, etc. 
Provide evidence that you have investigated relationships among the
predictors.

• Modelling
o Describe different classification techniques that you have considered for
this task.

• Evaluation
o Describe in detail how you have tested your models. To earn high marks,
you should show evidence of using different robust measures to evaluate
the modelling techniques you have selected.

• Conclusion (Deployment)
o This section includes findings and conclusions from your analysis.

Analaysis Results:
The analysis is explained in the 'Machine_learning_model_report' whith all the descriptive statistics, pre-processing, imputation and outputs of Machine Learning models.
The R code for pre-processing and all the built models are uploaded.
